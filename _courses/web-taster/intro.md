      ## A web page is made of three main languages

    notes: |

      Websites are made of many languages, but your most basic web page, what you see in your browser, is made up of three programming languages.

      That's three different types of code, each with their own rules.

      They all work together to display what you see on the screen.

      ### **HTML** is the markup language

    notes: |

      HTML is used to define the content of a web page: the words, the pictures, the links.

      It does not define any sizes, colours or layout.

      HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language.

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you see only the HTML - no CSS or Javascript.

      ### **CSS** is the style sheet language

    notes: |

      CSS is used to define the appearance of a web page: the colours, the sizes, the layout.

      It can be thought of as the design language.

      It tells our web browser how to display the HTML.

      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you combine the HTML and CSS.

      ### **JavaScript** is the programming language

    notes: |

      JavaScript is used to define any interactivity on a web page: dropdowns, popups, anything that changes after the page is first loaded.

      It can be thought of as the interaction language.

      JavaScript is often known as JS for short, and is actually quite different from Java, which is another programming laguage with a similar name. Tricky!

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you see all the HTML, CSS and JS working together.

      ### Workshop Mission:

      # HTML & CSS

    notes: |

      In this workshop we are just going to be covering HTML and CSS.

      We're going to start by playing with some small pieces of code to get the hang of it.

      After that we will get right on to building our own individual websites.

      ## What We're Making

      <p data-height="550" style="height:550px;" data-theme-id="19418" data-slug-hash="yerRvR" data-default-tab="result" data-user="gatherworkshops" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/gatherworkshops/pen/yerRvR/'>Otter Page Layout Demo</a> by Gather Workshops (<a href='http://codepen.io/gatherworkshops'>@gatherworkshops</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
        <script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script> 

      We'll use basic-level HTML and CSS to create this masterpiece!
