      # The Internet

      _How it all works_

      # What is the Internet?

      If a 5-year-old asked you "What is the Internet?"
      how would you answer?

    notes: |

      Before we start coding, let's have a think about what the Internet actually is.

      How would you explain it to a younger friend or family member?

      Could you exlain in just one sentence?

      ## Internet Brainstorm

      What do we use the Internet for?

      How do we access the Internet?

      Who pays for the Internet, and who gets paid?

    notes: |

      Maybe it would be easier to describe the Internet in smaller pieces. Have a go at answering these questions:

      - What do we use the Internet for?

      - How do we access the Internet?

      - Who pays for the Internet, and who gets paid?

      See if you can come up with at least one answer for each of the questions above.

      # The Internet <br>vs<br> The World Wide Web

      What's the difference?


    notes: |

      So, the next challenge is this: of the words you came up with, which ones relate to the Internet, and which ones relate to the World Wide Web?

      We quite often use the phrases _The Web_ and _The Internet_ to mean the same thing, but you may be surprised to learn that they are in fact quite different.

      Any idea what the difference might be?

      - ### The Internet
        A global system of interconnected computer networks.
        **The Internet is a network**
        **of computer networks.**
      

      - ### World Wide Web
        A system of interlinked documents, accessed via the Internet.
        **The Web is a network** 
        **of documents and media.**
      {:.flex-list}


    notes: |

      The Internet is what we use to access the World Wide Web.

      The World Wide Web is the content that we consume.

      When we create a website on the World Wide Web, we are contributing to the set of _interlinked documents_.

      When we access the Internet, we are making use of a worldwide network of _interlinked computers_.

      Can you identify which of your Internet-related words from earlier apply to the Internet, and which ones really apply to the World Wide Web?

      ### Chorus owns the Southern Cross Cable

      They could slow down international requests for other ISPs

    notes: |

      The Southern Cross Cable is our only connection to the outside world.

      It carries all our phone and internet communication.

      ## Loading a Webpage

      ![Diagram of how a web page is served](assets/images/diagram_http.png)


    notes: |

      So how does our computer load a web page over the Internet?

      First of all the client, your computer, sends a URL request like "youtube.com" to your ISP (eg. Orcon, Spark or Vodafone).

      Your ISP sends a request to the Domain Name Server, which turns the URL into an IP Address.

      Using the IP Address, your ISP can find the actual server where the web page files are stored, and send them back to your computer. 

      All these separate parts are owned by different people.

      ## Kinda like telephones!

      The Internet can be compared to the telephone system:

      - Nobody owns the whole thing
      - Companies do control individual parts
      - Telephone numbers and IP addresses are unique
      - There is no central control room


    notes: |

      Telephone numbers, IP addresses and street addresses are all unique locations across the whole planet.
  
      If one person's telephone stops working, or one city's phone system stops working, or even a whole country, phones will continue to work.

      The Internet is the same. It is _decentralised_ which means that it has no central control room and it can still function as a whole if some parts stop working.
