    notes: |

      Welcome to Building the Web!

      This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of web development through a few short coding challenges.

      By the end of the workshop you will have coded and published your very own web page!

      ## Say hi to your mentors!

      Your mentors are here to help if you get stuck,
      and you can ask them (almost) anything!  

    notes: |

      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)

      ## Schedule

      **How the Internet Works**
      **HTML and CSS Basics**

      _Morning Break_

      **Website Files**

      **Fancy Fonts and Gallery**
      **Go Live!**


    notes: |

      Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

      In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages. 

      After morning tea we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We'll look at the files that run a website and how to make them display what we want.

      After lunch we will add some fancy extras to our site, like some fancy fonts and an interactive gallery. Then we will publish our sites so we can share them with our friends.

      # Who owns it all?

      _Who owns the Internet?_
      _And who owns the Web?_



    notes: |

      So who owns the Internet?

      And who owns the web?

      Telecom? The United States? Whoever invented it?




  - content: |

      ## Who owns the Internet?
      - Nobody
      - Lots of people  

      ## Who owns the World Wide Web?
      - Content Creators
      - You!



    notes: |

      Nobody can claim ownership of the Internet, but many people own parts of the system which make the Internet possible.

      The web is a set of documents, so nobody can claim ownership of the web either.

      You still own your own contribution though, right?

      ### An ISP can charge extra to allow access <br> to your favourite website

      e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google


    notes: |

      What if the government or Spark decided you had to pay $10 for every YouTube video you watched?

      What if you had to pay an extra $50 a month for access to Facebook?

      Even though YouTube and Facebook themselves are free, it is possible for ISPs to know what data you are accessing from which websites, and charge you for that.

      ### A government can censor access to information

      e.g. North Korea and China

    notes: |

      Internet access is illegal in North Korea. Only a very few government officials have access to the Internet through a secret connection. The rest of the citizens only have access to the country's own intranet.

      This way, the government can control everything their citizens read on the Internet, and ensures that nothing is published which disagrees with the government.

      China controls all search engines to ensure that the citizens can find only the information they allow them to find.

      ### Chorus owns the Southern Cross Cable

      They could slow down international requests for other ISPs


    notes: |

      The Southern Cross Cable is our only connection to the outside world.

      It carries all our phone and internet communication.

      ## Your corner of the web

      By creating your own website, you are taking ownership of a small portion of the world wide web. 

      **It's all yours.**

      You can publish and share anything you like, go forth and create!


    notes: |

      Making our own website lets us shape the internet and share information with anyone in the world.

      What would you like to share? Have a think about it, because today you get to make a website about anything you like.

      Cats? Rugby? Surfing? Unicorns? Movies? Yourself? Anything goes. Have a think.
