      ## Say hi to your mentors!

      Your mentors are here to help if you get stuck,
      and you can ask them (almost) anything!  

    notes: |

      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)

      Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

      In the first part we will look at how the Internet works and what this means for us as coders, plus take a look at the basics of web code languages. 

      After morning tea we will start working on our own websites, so think about a topic! We'll look at the files that run a website and how to make them display what we want.

      After lunch we will add some fancy extras to our site, like some fancy fonts and an interactive gallery. Then we will publish our sites so we can share them with our friends.
