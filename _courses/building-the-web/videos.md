      ## Videos

      Last up, a YouTube video!

      Create another section as usual, but this time copy in the "Embed" code for a video from YouTube.

      ```html
      <section class="videos">

          <h2>Videos</h2>

          <!-- Paste embed code here -->

      </section>
      ```

      - Find a video you like
      - Click "Share", then click "Embed"
      - Copy the code, and use it in your site!

    notes: |
        Add in a video section too, and include a few YouTube videos.
