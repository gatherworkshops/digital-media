      # Ownership
      _Who owns your content?_

      # Who owns it all?

      _Who owns the Internet?_
      _And who owns the Web?_
    
    notes: |

      So who owns the Internet?

      And who owns the web?

      Telecom? The United States? Whoever invented it?

      ## Who owns the Internet?

      - Nobody
      - Lots of people

      ## Who owns the World Wide Web?

      - Content Creators
      - You!

    notes: |
      Nobody can claim ownership of the Internet, but many people own parts of the system which make the Internet possible.

      The web is a set of documents, so nobody can claim ownership of the web either.

      You still own your own contribution though, right?

      ### An ISP can charge extra to allow access <br> to your favourite website

      e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google

    notes: |
      What if the government or Spark decided you had to pay $10 for every YouTube video you watched?

      What if you had to pay an extra $50 a month for access to Facebook?

      Even though YouTube and Facebook themselves are free, it is possible for ISPs to know what data you are accessing from which websites, and charge you for that.

      ### A government can censor access to information

      e.g. North Korea and China

    notes: |
      Internet access is illegal in North Korea. Only a very few government officials have access to the Internet through a secret connection. The rest of the citizens only have access to the country's own intranet.

      This way, the government can control everything their citizens read on the Internet, and ensures that nothing is published which disagrees with the government.

      China controls all search engines to ensure that the citizens can find only the information they allow them to find.
