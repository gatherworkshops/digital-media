      _How we create using code_

      ### A web page is made of three main languages

    notes: |

      Websites are made of many languages, but your most basic web page, what you see in your browser, is made up of three programming languages.

      That's three different types of code, each with their own rules.

      They all work together to display what you see on the screen.

      ### **HTML** is the markup language

      ![Screenshot of Google with only HTML enabled](assets/images/google-html.png){:height="350"}

      HTML is used to define the content of a web page.


    notes: |

      HTML is used to define the content of a web page: the words, the pictures, the links.

      It does not define any sizes, colours or layout.

      HTML stand for HyperText Markup Language.

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you see only the HTML - no CSS or Javascript.

      ### **CSS** is the style sheet language

      ![Screenshot of Google with both HTML and CSS enabled](assets/images/google-css.png){:height="350"}

      CSS is used to define the design of a web page.


    notes: |

      CSS is used to define the appearance of a web page: the colours, the sizes, the layout.

      It can be thought of as the _design language_.

      It tells our web browser how to display the HTML.

      CSS stands for _Cascading Style Sheets_.

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you combine the HTML and CSS.

      ### **JavaScript** is the programming language

      ![Screenshot of Google with all of HTML, CSS, JS enabled](assets/images/google-javascript.png){:height="350"}

      JavaScript is used to define the interactions of a web page.


    notes: |

      JavaScript is used to define any interactivity on a web page: dropdowns, popups, anything that changes after the page is first loaded.

      It can be thought of as the _interaction language_.

      JavaScript is often known as JS for short, and is actually quite different from Java, which is another programming laguage with a similar name. Tricky!

      This is a picture of what Google looks like when you see all the HTML, CSS and JS working together.

      ## HTML + CSS + JS = Website!

      You already know two of these, woohoo!


    notes: |

      Every web site that we visit is made up of all these files.

      There are HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files and also files in lots of other languages.

      Other programming languages are used for making more complex websites, with user accounts you can log in to, or shopping sites where you can buy things.
