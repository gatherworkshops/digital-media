      ## Keeping Originals

  - content: |

      It is important to keep the originals in case you need to make changes which can't be done from your modified photos.

  - content: |

      Create a folder called original-images.


  - content: |

      Add this folder to jekyll ignore, as we don't want these included in our published site.


  - content: |

      Never edit in your originals folder. Always copy the image to your images folder before editing it.

      ## Images Folder

  - content: |

      Create a folder called 'images'.

  - content: |

      You can have subfolders in here if you like, for example 'gallery' and 'shop'.

  - content: |

      This folder contains your **content** images. Images that you want to use in your theme go in your theme.
